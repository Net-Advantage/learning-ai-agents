# Getting Started

Set the agent to the `Orchestrator` custom agent.

Try these two prompts:

```text
Create work items for the #file:PAYE-calculator.spec.md to build an MVP.
```

Check that all the work items have been created.

Then run the following prompt:

```text
Implement the work items for the #file:PAYE-calculator.spec.md to code the MVP.
```

That's it.
